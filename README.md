# ListView

Sencon Programming Exercises

Exercise 3:
Create a separate class library project. Add a class to the project that inherits from ListView. The new list view should contain three columns one to show a string, 
one to show an integer and one to show a date. When you click on a column header the list is sorted based on the column clicked, initially in ascending order. 
If the column header is clicked again the list will again be sorted but in descending order. Add the new control to a windows form and add some default data to test.
